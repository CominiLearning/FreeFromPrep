# MVP Proposal: Hindi & Hinglish Tutor for Calculus (Approximate Build Time: Two/Three Weeks)

## Problem Statement

Many Class 11-12 students in India study mathematics in **Hindi or Hinglish** (a mix of Hindi and English terms), but most online learning resources for calculus are only in **pure English**. This creates a **language barrier**, making it difficult for students to understand concepts like **derivatives, integration, and limits**.

There is a need for a **simple, voice-enabled learning tool** that allows students to **ask questions in Hindi or Hinglish** and get **step-by-step explanations in their preferred language**. By incorporating **voice input & output**, this tool will also help students who prefer to listen instead of reading long text responses.

## Scope of the MVP (What Can Be Built in Two Weeks?)

For the initial MVP, we will focus on building a **basic voice-assisted Q&A chatbot** that:
- ‚úÖ Supports **text & voice input** in **Hindi and Hinglish** (e.g., "Derivative kya hota hai?" or "‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ù‡•á ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ï‡§≤‡§® ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§ù‡§æ‡§ì")
- ‚úÖ Provides **step-by-step solutions** for **5 basic differentiation problems**, responding in **text + voice output**
- ‚úÖ Displays **math formulas correctly** using LaTeX rendering
- ‚úÖ Works as a **lightweight web app** without requiring complex AI initially

## How It Works (MVP Implementation Plan)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Preloading (Days 1-3)
* Extract relevant **Hindi and Hinglish** calculus content from **NCERT Hindi textbooks** (available as PDFs).
* Select **10 common calculus questions** and their **Hindi + Hinglish explanations** (e.g., *"‡§ó‡•Å‡§£‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ï ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§π‡•à?"* ‚Üí *"‡§ó‡•Å‡§£‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ï ‡§è‡§ï ‡§ó‡§£‡§ø‡§§‡•Ä‡§Ø ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§ú‡•ã ‡§è‡§ï ‡§´‡§≤‡§® ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¶‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§§ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à‡•§"*)
* Prepare **5 differentiation problems** with **step-by-step solutions** in Hindi and Hinglish.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Chatbot UI with Text Input (Days 4-7)
* Build a **simple web-based chatbot UI** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) where students can **type** calculus questions in **Hindi or Hinglish**.
* Implement **retrieval-based logic** with **preloaded answers** instead of AI initially.
* Add a **dropdown menu** for students to pick one of **5 differentiation problems** and receive a **step-by-step solution**.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Enable Voice Input & Output (Days 8-10)
* **Voice Input:**
   * Integrate **Web Speech API** or Google Speech-to-Text API to allow students to **ask questions by speaking** in **Hindi or Hinglish**.
   * Ensure it recognizes **math terms in Hinglish**, e.g., "Integration ka kya matlab hota hai?"
* **Voice Output:**
   * Use **Text-to-Speech (TTS) APIs** (Google TTS, ResponsiveVoice, or Speech Synthesis API) to **read answers aloud in Hindi**.
   * Ensure the TTS can **read both Hindi and Hinglish properly** (e.g., "Limit ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§Æ‡§§‡§≤‡§¨ infinity ‡§§‡§ï ‡§ú‡§æ‡§®‡§æ ‡§π‡•à").

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Math Display & Final Testing (Days 11-14)
* Integrate **MathJax or KaTeX** for rendering **calculus formulas correctly**.
* Test with **real students** to **refine responses** and **fix any errors** in text/voice interactions.
* Deploy as a **static webpage** (on GitHub Pages or Netlify).

## Future Expansion Possibilities

üöÄ After validating the MVP, we can enhance it with:
- ‚úÖ **More calculus topics** (integration, limits, differential equations)
- ‚úÖ **Interactive quizzes** with voice-enabled hints
- ‚úÖ **AI-driven tutoring** to generate more personalized responses
- ‚úÖ **Offline mode** for students with poor internet access

## Expected Impact (Why This Matters?)

- üìå **Immediate Benefit:** Hindi and Hinglish-medium students can **understand calculus** without English-language struggles.
- üìå **Scalability:** If successful, this can be **expanded into a full-fledged AI tutor**.
- üìå **Accessibility:** **Voice input & output** makes learning easier for students who struggle with reading long explanations.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Speech Recognition:** Web Speech API / Google Speech-to-Text
* **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Google TTS / ResponsiveVoice / Speech Synthesis API
