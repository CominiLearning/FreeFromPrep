# **FreeFromPrep: Free Exam Prep / Freedom From Prep**

## **Your Challenge: Help Us Build the Future of Exam Preparation**

We think exams are outdated and obsolete. There are better ways to measure competence and readiness in 2025. And yet exams are a big part of our lives and will continue to be for a few years. We want to enable deeper learning by first allowing people to crack exams effortlessly. FreeFromPrep is, and will be, an open-source, free exam prep service for all Indians. Whether it is CBSE exams for 7th class or CTET exams. We can build this together.

Free and open-source means free access to everyone without any expensive coaching classes or tutorials. AI makes it possible. Here is something we put together in under 24 hours [Demo Prep Copilot](https://tryripples.comini.in/)

We want your help to make it better. And we are offering grants from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 1 Lakh to students across India to work on this.

>This is an excellent opportunity to showcase your skills while contributing to educational technology. All contributions will be publicly available, and any features or improvements that are incorporated into the project **will be credited to their creators**.

### **Project Plan**

Document your approach before diving in. What will you tackle first? How will you break this down into manageable pieces? We want to see your thought process.

### **Learning Journey**

Create a LEARNING.md in your repository. Use this to document:

- Technical challenges you faced
- How you solved them
- What you learned along the way
- Design decisions and their reasoning
- Things you'd do differently next time

Keep it real - we're interested in your authentic experience and growth through this project.

## **Important Note About AI Usage**

We are looking for evidence that you can think through/code different aspects of this problem. We want you to be able to think through ramifications and not just outsource it entirely to ChatGPT/LLMs. This is increasingly important as we find that many who are outsourcing programming to LLMs don't understand the code. This results in multiple issues â€” it is inefficient, has security vulnerabilities, unknown bugs, and more. This ultimately makes for a bad product too. So please be mindful and meaningful in its use.

## **Important Note About Responsive Design**

It is mentioned above, but worth reiterating. The application should be usable on mobile and desktop. Making learning activities accessible means designing for the most common screen sizes in India in home and classroom settings.

## **A Bit About Us**

**Anyone can learn anything!**

**Anyone can learn anything!**

We are [Comini Learning](https://www.comini.in/).

We truly believe this, and we are building an ecosystem of tools to help make it happen. Starting with early education, we're creating a new, **playful, personalized, and meaningful way of learning**.

Our approach combines both offline and online experiences:
- We run [microschools](https://www.comini.in/) that bring learning to life
- We develop online learning tools that adapt to each student
- We're building [learning copilots](https://tryripples.comini.in/) to support parents and educators

We realized that to enable personalized meaningful offline learning, we need to build our own full-stack of technology & AI tools that help with the philosophy (why), process (how), and practice (what) of learning. 

One of our key initiatives is [Zippie, our "microschool in a box"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqjGiSW8G_s) that integrates all these elements from the ground up.
