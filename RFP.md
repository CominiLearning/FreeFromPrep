# **FreeFromPrep India-Focused RFP**

## Request for Proposals

This document outlines specific problem areas where innovative solutions are needed for the FreeFromPrep initiative. Please refer to the [README](README.md) for general information about FreeFromPrep and how to apply for grants.

## Why FreeFromPrep?

Millions of students in India prepare for school and competitive exams with limited resources. Quality coaching and materials are often expensive or unavailable in local languages. FreeFromPrep seeks to leverage open educational content and AI technology to empower learners across India – especially those in underserved and rural communities – to learn effectively at no cost.

## How to Use this Document

Below, we've categorized problem statements by educational level and challenge type. Each problem is phrased as a direct challenge (not a question) to solve. They range from content-focused needs (e.g., creating or organizing study material) to technology-focused needs (e.g., developing offline capabilities, AI tutors, multilingual support). Pick a challenge that resonates with you, and consider how you could build a solution for it. We encourage you to be ambitious yet practical in your proposals. Refer to the Sample Proposal: "A Hindi Tutor for Calculus" at the end for guidance on structuring your ideas with actionable steps.

Let's make exam prep accessible and free from barriers together!

## Problem Areas and Challenge Categories

### Early Learning (Pre-school & Primary Education)

Young children need engaging, mother-tongue resources to build foundational skills. We seek solutions that make early education fun, accessible, and bilingual.

#### Interactive Bilingual Storytelling App for Pre-schoolers

Develop a free app that offers simple stories and rhymes in English and one regional language (e.g., Hindi or Tamil). It should engage young children with audio narration and pictures, helping them learn language and vocabulary in both tongues.

**Start with this MVP**: Create a simple web-based story reader that plays a single Hindi-English story with synchronized text highlighting and audio narration. Use open-source children's story content.

#### Multilingual Math Games for Classes 1-5

Create fun, game-based learning activities for primary school mathematics. The games should work offline and provide instructions in regional languages (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, etc.), so kids in rural areas can practice basic math skills without internet.

**Start with this MVP**: Develop a simple interactive multiplication quiz in Hindi, Tamil, and English, with voice-based instructions and feedback.

#### Voice-Based Learning Assistant for Early Learners

Build a voice-interactive tutor for young children who may not read yet. For example, a child (or parent) could speak in Hindi or Bengali to ask for an alphabet lesson or a math quiz, and the assistant would respond with an engaging activity or story. This would help families with low literacy guide their kids' learning at home.

**Start with this MVP**: Implement a prototype that allows children to say a letter in Hindi (e.g., "क") and hear an associated word with an image.

### CBSE 6-8 (Middle School)

Middle school is when students build crucial skills and often switch to English-medium education. We need solutions that reinforce concepts and help bridge language gaps.

#### Curriculum-Aligned Resource Hub for Classes 6-8

Create an organized collection of free videos, notes, and exercises aligned to the CBSE 6th-8th grade syllabus. For example, a Class 7 student could find topic-wise links to NCERT chapter notes, YouTube science experiments, and practice questions – all curated in one place.

**Start with this MVP**: Create a GitHub repository with a structured syllabus index for Class 6 Science and add 5-10 high-quality open resources per topic.

#### Bilingual Glossary and Guide for Science & Math

Develop a tool that explains key science and math terms in simple language and in Hindi/Tamil/etc. Many students struggle when transitioning to English textbooks in Class 6-8. A glossary with definitions and analogies in their mother tongue would help them grasp concepts faster.

**Start with this MVP**: Develop a spreadsheet of 100+ bilingual math/science terms with definitions in English and Hindi.

#### Interactive Quiz Bot for Class 7-8 Revision

Build a chat-based quiz system that students can use to revise chapters. For instance, a Class 8 student could chat with the bot (in English or Hindi) to get quick questions on a chapter (like Cell Biology or Algebra) and receive instant feedback and explanations.

**Start with this MVP**: Create a Telegram bot that asks 10 Class 8 science questions and provides immediate feedback.

### CBSE 9-10 (Secondary School)

Classes 9 and 10 are critical for board exams. Students need strong conceptual understanding and ample practice, often in both English and Hindi mediums.

#### Adaptive AI Tutor for CBSE 10th Grade Mathematics

Develop an AI-powered tutor that personalizes math practice for Class 10 students. It would adapt to the student's level – for example, if a student struggles with quadratic equations, it provides easier problems and step-by-step hints in real time (in English or Hindi).

**Start with this MVP**: Develop a rule-based chatbot that asks five quadratic equation questions and adapts difficulty based on correct/incorrect answers.

#### Class 10 Board Exam Question Bank & Solutions

Aggregate past CBSE Class 10 board exam questions from free sources and provide detailed solutions.

**Start with this MVP**: Collect and format CBSE Class 10 Math past 3 years' board exam questions in a markdown repository.

### Competitive Exams Preparation

Competitive exams in India (JEE, NEET, CUET, CTET, UPSC, etc.) are high-stakes and content-heavy. There's a need for free, high-quality preparatory material that rivals expensive coaching, with support for multiple languages.

#### Mastering Organic Chemistry for JEE Aspirants

Develop content and tools to help engineering aspirants conquer organic chemistry – a subject that many find difficult.

**Start with this MVP**: Create a PDF guide with 10 key reaction mechanisms, mnemonic aids, and step-by-step explanations.

#### Comprehensive NEET Biology Prep Platform

Assemble a one-stop prep platform for NEET (medical entrance) Biology, including chapter-wise notes, diagrams, and a practice question bank.

**Start with this MVP**: Build a markdown repository with NCERT-aligned NEET Biology chapter notes.
